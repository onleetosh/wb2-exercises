//Create a Java application called TheaterReservations. This application is used to
//allow customers to reserve tickets for a specific date.
//Prompt the user for their full name, the date of the show, and the number of
//tickets they will need. Once the reservation is made, display a confirmation message to the customer in
//this format: # ticket(s) reserved for (date) under (LastName, FirstName)
// If only one ticket is reserved, the confirmation should not include an "s"
